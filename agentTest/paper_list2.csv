2508.12345,Advancing Multimodal Reasoning in Large Language Models,Alice Johnson; Bob Smith,"As technology scales, nano-scale digital circuits face heightened
susceptibility to single event upsets (SEUs) and transients (SETs) due to
shrinking feature sizes and reduced operating voltages. While logical,
electrical, and timing masking effects influence soft error probability (SEP),
the combined impact of process variation (PV) and aging-induced degradation
further complicates SEP estimation. Existing approaches often address PV or
aging in isolation, or rely on computationally intensive methods like Monte
Carlo simulations, limiting their practicality for large-scale circuit
optimization. This paper introduces a novel framework for SEP analysis that
holistically integrates PV and aging effects. We propose an enhanced electrical
masking model and a statistical methodology to quantify soft error probability
under process and aging variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves high accuracy while reducing computational overhead
by approximately 2.5% compared to Monte Carlo-based methods. This work advances
the design of reliable nano-scale circuits by enabling efficient, accurate SEP
estimation in the presence of manufacturing variability and long-term
transistor degradation."
