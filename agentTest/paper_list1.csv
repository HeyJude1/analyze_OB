2212.10275,MultiPL-E: A Scalable and Extensible Approach to Benchmarking Neural Code Generation,"Federico Cassano, John Gouwar, Daniel Nguyen, Sydney Nguyen, Luna Phipps-Costin, Donald Pinckney, Ming-Ho Yee, Yangtian Zi, Carolyn Jane Anderson, Molly Q Feldman, Arjun Guha, Michael Greenberg, Abhinav Jangda","We introduce anchored radial observations (ARO), a novel shape encoding for
learning implicit field representation of 3D shapes that is category-agnostic
and generalizable amid significant shape variations. The main idea behind our
work is to reason about shapes through partial observations from a set of
viewpoints, called anchors. We develop a general and unified shape
representation by employing a fixed set of anchors, via Fibonacci sampling, and
designing a coordinate-based deep neural network to predict the occupancy value
of a query point in space. Differently from prior neural implicit models that
use global shape feature, our shape encoder operates on contextual,
query-specific features. To predict point occupancy, locally observed shape
information from the perspective of the anchors surrounding the input query
point are encoded and aggregated through an attention module, before implicit
decoding is performed. We demonstrate the quality and generality of our
network, coined ARO-Net, on surface reconstruction from sparse point clouds,
with tests on novel and unseen object categories, ""one-shape"" training, and
comparisons to state-of-the-art neural and classical methods for reconstruction
and tessellation."
2505.04567,CodeMixBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Code Generation with Code-Mixed Prompts,"Manik Sheokand, Parth Sawant","This paper presents a methodology for automatically generating processors
that support a subset of the RISC-V instruction set for a new class of
applications at Extreme Edge. The electronics used in extreme edge applications
must be power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low
cost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather
than silicon-based electronics, will be capable of meeting these qualities. For
this purpose, we propose a methodology to generate RISPs (RISC-V instruction
subset processors) customised to extreme edge applications and to implement
them as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology is unique in
the sense that verification is an integral part of design. The RISP methodology
treats each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional,
pre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by
stitching together the hardware blocks of the instructions required by an
application or a set of applications in a specific domain. This approach
significantly reduces the processor verification and its time-to-market. We
generate RISPs using this methodology for three extreme edge applications, and
embedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite, synthesize them as
FlexICs, and compare their power, performance and area to the baselines. Our
results show that RISPs generated using this methodology achieve, on average,
30% reductions in power and area compared to a RISC-V processor supporting the
full instruction set when synthesized, and are nearly 30 times more energy
efficient with respect to Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor.
In addition, the full physical implementation of RISPs show up to 21% and 26%
less area and power than Serv."
2502.03456,CodeSCM: Causal Analysis for Multi-Modal Code Generation,"Mukur Gupta, Noopur Bhatt, Suman Jana","To make predictions or design control, information on local sensitivity of
initial conditions and state-space contraction is both central, and often
instrumental. However, it is not always simple to reliably determine
instability fields or local dissipation rates, due to computational challenges
or ignorance of the governing equations. Here, we construct an alternative
route towards that goal, by estimating the Jacobian of a discrete-time
dynamical system locally from the entries of the transition matrix that
approximates the Perron-Frobenius operator for a given state-space partition.
Numerical tests on one- and two-dimensional chaotic maps show promising
results."
